  /* Configure the files you would like to upload to Bintray and their upload path.
  You can define one or more groups of patterns.
  Each group contains three patterns:

  includePattern: Pattern in the form of Ruby regular expression, indicating the path of files to be uploaded to Bintray.
  excludePattern: Optional. Pattern in the form of Ruby regular expression, indicating the path of files to be removed from the list of files specified by the includePattern.
  uploadPattern: Upload path on Bintray. The path can contain symbols in the form of $1, $2,... that are replaced with capturing groups defined in the include pattern.

  In the example below, the following files are uploaded,
  1. All gem files located under build/bin/ (including sub directories),
  except for files under a the do-not-deploy directory.
  The files will be uploaded to Bintray under the gems folder.
  2. All files under build/docs. The files will be uploaded to Bintray under the docs folder.

  Note: Regular expressions defined as part of the includePattern property must be wrapped with brackets. */
